# Code Refactor Horiseon website

The Horiseon marketing agency wants a codebase that follows accessibility standards. They want their site to be optimized for search engines. 

I refactored their site with these criteria in mind: 

does it have semantic HTML?

does it have descritive alt tags on images?

do all the links work?

is the CSS commented?

is the CSS consolidated?
